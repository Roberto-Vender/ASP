Enrollment Situation Problem

At XYZ University, the enrollment process for the upcoming semester has begun. Anna, a freshman, is excited to register for her courses. However, she faces several challenges:

Prerequisite Issue: She wants to enroll in "Advanced Mathematics," but the system denies her request, stating that she has not completed the prerequisite course, "Basic Mathematics."

Schedule Conflict: Anna selects "Computer Science 101" and "Physics 101," but the system alerts her that these classes overlap on her schedule.

She wanted to create her own schedules not only block sectioning.

Task
As an IT administrator for XYZ University, how would you resolve these issues within the enrollment system to ensure a smooth registration process for all students?

Typically enrollment system consists of several subsystems that work together to manage student registration and related processes efficiently. 

Student Information Management Subsystem
-Stores and manages student records, including personal details, academic history, and enrollment status.

Course Management Subsystem
-Handles course offerings, schedules, prerequisites.

Registration and Enrollment Subsystem
-Manages student registration, course selection, and enrollment verification.

Class Scheduling Subsystem
-Automates class scheduling, assigns rooms, and prevents scheduling conflicts.

Reporting and Analytics Subsystem
-Generates reports on enrollment statistics.

*You may add other subsystems.
